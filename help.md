- Basic movement: hjkl
- h - up level/close; j - next; k - previous; l - down level/open
- e - expand (more)
- Q - exit
- Current status
	- ~~Expect it blow up any time~~
	- ~~Looks like it's working~~
	- Making improvements
- Browsing mode keys
	- h, j, k, l - level-aware movement
	- h, j - scrolling current entry when in partial view mode
	- n, m - visual movement
	- JK - move current entry down/up
	- HL - de/indent current entry
	- In other words hjkl is normal movement, HJKL is 'dragging' movement
	- e, c - expand (more/all), collapse all
	- d - toggle entry done (cross-out)
	- D - delete current entry
	- U - try to restore the last deleted element (aka undo)
		- This tries to put the restored element where it was before deletion. In theory the restored element should appear near wherever the next, previous or parent element of the deleted entry currently is. But please be careful with realying on this too much.
	- File operations
		- r - reload current file
		- s - save current file
		- o - open another file
		- S - save current list as
	- Additional functions
		- F1 - show absolute path to current file
		- F2 - show version and legal information
	- <enter> - edit current entry, switches to edit mode
	- i - insert new entry, switches to edit mode
- Editing mode keys
	- <home>, <end> - move the cursor to beginning, end
	- <cursor keys> - line-aware movement
	- <enter> - finish editing
- Command line
	- Just run it with '-h' to get the list
	- As well as the locale, so you may use a decent UTF-8 one
	- Fixed-column mode can now be overridden
- Configuration
	- Most stuff can be configured by editing user.h
		- You can adjust bullet glyphs there
		- And also translate most of the UI
	- You can modify colors in colors.c
	- Changing key bindings is somewhat more involved, but feel free to extract the currently hard-coded ones into a separate header file (e.g. keys.h)
- File format information
	- Markdown compatible (uses '~~' for crossed-out items, so technically the format is GFM - GitHub Flavoured Markdown)
	- It is very important to use tabs for indentation
	- The file should be encoded according to the current locale
- Bugs/Features
	- You'll need to write file paths by hand, like on the C64
	- When opening a file the file access error also includes non-existent file, so first check if the path is ok
	- Resizing will work only when in browsing mode, and may still be rather wonky
	- While you should be able to browse wide-character lists (e.g. Japanese), editing won't work, probably
	- No word-wrapping
	- No spell-checking
	- Expand function works funny. It's 'expand more' with a fresh file, and then turns into 'expand all'
- Unicode test... (bonus)
	- Jak się masz? Świetnie!
	- Как дела? Отлично!
	- ¿Cómo estás? ¡Genial!
	- Comment ça va? Super!
