# Simple Hierarchical Notebook [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drbig/snb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drbig/snb)

![SNB in action](https://raw.github.com/drbig/snb/master/snb.png)

Minimal nested list browser and editor with locale support and ncurses interface.

Features / Bugs:

- File format is Markdown compatible (GFM to be exact)
- Works with multi-byte encodings (including Unicode)
- Editing wide-char (e.g. Japanese) languages doesn't work yet, but browsing should
- Keyboard driven 'content oriented' UI
- Configuration by editing an include file
- The produced binary is all that is needed
- Ncursesw is the only runtime dependency

*STATUS:* **Alpha - looks like it's working.**

## Setup

**NOTE**: If you're not using a `UTF-8` locale you should edit `src/user.h` before compiling, as the default bullet strings use Unicode glyphs.

    $ git clone https://github.com/drbig/snb.git
    $ cd snb
    $ make debug

~~If the build fails the most probable cause is you don't have ncursesw, or there is a configuration problem. Check `Makefile` and adjust paths for includes and/or `ncursesw` library.~~ The Makefile is now a bit smarter. If you can successfully run `ncursesw5-config` then any compile problems are probably due to something else (please make file an issue via GitHub in such case).

If the build is successful:

    $ ./bin/snb help.md

This should start snb and present you with an introductory list to help you figure out the key bindings.

## Usage and configuration

In the current state I recommend running the debug build. Once the binary is compiled it has no dependencies, so feel free to put wherever you want (e.g. `~/bin`). As stated previously, `help.md` will introduce you to current default key bindings and some other information.

The binary accepts a single argument of a file to load on startup.

You can configure the UI appearance by editing `src/user.h` and perhaps `src/colors.c`. You can also set a default file that snb will try to load if no arguments were supplied, however remember the path should be absolute.

## Contributing

Feel free to hack the code to your liking.

If you wish to contribute back please:

1. clone the repository
2. make your changes on a separate branch
3. make sure you have run `make full-check` before committing and there were no errors reported (you'll need a bunch of additional tools for that, listed below)
4. make a pull request

In other words follow the usual GitHub development workflow.

The tools needed for `make full-check`:

1. [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) - so there is no need to discuss tastes
2. [Check](http://check.sourceforge.net/) - for automated testing
3. [Clang Analyzer](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) - for static code analysis

I would also recommend the following tools:

1. [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) - for memory leak analysis, and much more
2. [GDB](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) - yes, it really is as useful as they say
3. [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) - for pretty HTML docs

Personally I know I won't start any new C project without the above.

This was my first attempt at writing: a. non-trivial Unix program in C; b. locale aware program in C; c. ncurses-based interface. As such the code is rather clunky and rough, and you can follow the journey as I left the git history unaltered (do that on your own risk though).

However in the process I became good friends with [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/), [gdb](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) and [clang analyzer](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/). Eventually I got myself a working clone of the venerable [hnb](http://hnb.sourceforge.net/) that can speak languages.

The code has rudimentary comments and if you have [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) installed `make docs` will work. I've also written a very ugly test suite for the data handling part, and if you have [check](http://check.sourceforge.net/) installed `make check` should also work.

What is most need, in my humble opinion:

- Configurable key bindings
- Better terminal resize handling
- Tab-completion for open and save as dialogs
- Some abstractions could most probably be done better (i.e. `vitree` and `elmopen` stuff)
